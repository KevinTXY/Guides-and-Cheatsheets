# Guides-and-Cheatsheets
Some notes and cheatsheets for programming languages that I wrote or compiled myself, usually for friends.

I like taking notes, and even more so I enjoy teaching people. As a result, I'll be uploading any notes, cheatsheets, and documents that I create or compile from other sources here. 

Included so far:

 #### Python Guide:
  A Python guide focused around data structures and aimed towards assisting in programming interview preparation. First three pages written by me, last few were included from external source and are not my property.
